# number_guessing_game_using_python
A fun game where a user guesses a randomly chosen number.
In a number guessing game, a user attempts to guess a randomly generated secret number within a limited number of tries, receiving feedback (higher or lower) after each guess.
After each guess, the program provides feedback to the user, telling them whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct.
